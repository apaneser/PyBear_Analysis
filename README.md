# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

### Purpose
We have been assigned to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and then create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type in order to show how the data differs between data types.

## Results

in Rural areas, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver are higher than Suburban areas, which are higher than urban areas. The data shows that the fares decrease as the driver size increases. despite this, the total fares in urban areas are much higher than Suburban areas, which are much higher than Rural areas as the difference in driver sizes are exponential. However, Urban areas are the only place where there are more total drivers than total rides.

## Summary
The average fare per driver is far lower in urban areas than any other area and is also the only city type where the average fare per ride is higher than average fare per driver. This may have to do with the fact that there are more rides than drivers in urban areas according to the data, so it may be a good idea to decrease the amount of drivers there to increase the fare. Rural areas have much higher fares per ride compared to Urban areas, this likely means that people who ride share in urban areas tend to travel a larger distance than people in Urban areas. Despite this difference, Urban areas still have much higher total fares due to the much higher ride ount than the other city types.
